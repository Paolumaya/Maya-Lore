A fusion of monster and human.
Caused by the massive energy release during the slaying of Xeno'jiiva.
All appear to have some amount of control over their forms.
Observations on this front have found some sort of latent connection between Aberrations and the crystals in the Elder's Recess.
All three 

Documented cases:
- [[Liam & Horace]] - a Bowgunner fused with an Anjanath
- [[Theodore]] - An seasoned Insect Glaive user who merged and overwrote a Legiana
- [[Elara]] - Other Researcher who left with Maya that was fused with a Tzitzi-Ya-Ku.
- [[Jasper & Willow]] - Dual-Blades wielding twins that were fused into a Great Girros.
- 
- 
- [[Maya & Sadie + Amber]] - A Paolumu Research Specialist fused with a pair of Paolumu.
	- Maya was on an expedition to the Coral Highlands to study the pair, who were initially thought to be a same-sex female couple, due to Amber's claw length and dull stomach scale color, before Amber was reassessed as male. After 8 days of observation, Maya encountered them, laying together, both gravely injured by a fight with a Legiana. Both were hurt enough that Maya was able to approach. According to her, as she was tending to Amber's wounds, a blue light blinded her. She stumbled forward, onto the pair and passed out.
	  When she came to, her body was entirely different. Her legs had attached to the necks of the Paolumu, which had themselves fused into a hermaphroditic Paolumu.
