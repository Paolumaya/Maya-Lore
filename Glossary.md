## Aberration
An [[#Eldertouched]] fusion of at least one monster and at least one human. As with most Eldertouched, all appear to have some amount of control over their forms.
Observations on this front have found some sort of latent connection between Aberrations and the crystals in the Elder's Recess, which act as batteries for what has been named [[#Eldertaint|"Eldertaint"]]

All 7 of the known 'sane' Aberration cases:
- [[Characters/Specimen 1 - Liam & Horace|Specimen 1 - Liam & Horace]] - a Bowgunner fused with an Anjanath
- [[Characters/Specimen 2 - Theodore|Specimen 2 - Theodore]] - An seasoned, headstrong Insect Glaive user who merged with and partially overwrote a Legiana.
- [[Characters/Specimen 3 - Elara|Specimen 3 - Elara]] - Other Researcher who left with Maya that was fused with a Tzitzi-Ya-Ku.
- [Specimen 4 & 5 - Jasper & Rowan](Characters/Specimen%204%20&%205%20-%20Jasper%20&%20Rowan.md) - Dual-Blades-wielding twins that were fused into a Great Girros.
- [[Characters/Specimen 6 - Cecil|Specimen 6 - Cecil]] 
- [[Characters/Specimen 7 -Seraphina & Bloom|Specimen 7 -Seraphina & Bloom]] - A Bow user who has a Pukei-Pukei for her lower body. Bloom's head is now on her tail.
- [[Characters/Specimen 8 - Maya & Sadie + Amber|Specimen 8 - Maya & Sadie + Amber]] - A Paolumu Research Specialist fused with a pair of Paolumu.

## Abomination
A fusion of two or more [[#Eldertouched]] monsters. The most noticeable Abominations are between two different species, but are most commonly fusions within the same species.

Abominations are also much more common than Aberrations. This is also because human/monster contact is far more rare.
## Elderblooms
Macroflora created from exposure to [[#Eldertaint]]. Generally signify an area heavily affected by Eldertaint.

## Eldertaint
A strange energy released by Xeno'jiiva, which can radically alter any flora & fauna exposed to it in unpredictable ways.

## Eldertouched
Beings affected by the Eldertaint.

## Intraspecies Abominations
- Extremely common, and usually similar to the standard variations of their species.
	- The commonly visible outward signs of an Abomination are increased size and extraneous parts, including but not limited to heads, legs, and tails. These are not necessarily universal in a base state.
	- Exposure to Eldertaint sources often cause them to form.
- Usually otherwise indistinguishable from normal members of a species.
	- Gender-specific behaviors in intersex (male + female) fusion can cause confused actions, but usually these are fairly easy for the new being to correct over time.

## Interspecies Abominations
- Extremely uncommon, though extremely obvious in nearly all cases.
- Almost never a clean/stable mix.
	- Specimens are often seen shifting and changing between the parts of both monsters.
	- Stress is known to accelerate this process.
- Very often feral and out-of-control. Also extremely strong, usually above tempered monsters of the same species.
	- Slaying has been necessary in all cases, as sedation has little effect on them, similar to Elder Dragons.
- Eldertaint causes them to shift even more erratically and become EXTREMELY aggressive. Overexposure has been known to cause organ failure and in one case (a Bazelgeuse/Azure Rathalos Abomination) managed to obliterate itself by growing incomplete scales, which detonated on its hide.

## Irregularity
A (theoretical) Eldertouched fusion of two humans. None have been reported.
