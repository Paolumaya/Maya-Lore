## Aberration
An [[#Eldertouched]] fusion of at least one monster and at least one human. As with most Eldertouched, all appear to have some amount of control over their forms.
Observations on this front have found some sort of latent connection between Aberrations and the crystals in the Elder's Recess, which act as batteries for what has been named [[#Eldertaint|"Eldertaint"]]

All 7 of the known 'sane' Aberration cases:
- [[Specimens/1 - Liam & Horace|1 - Liam & Horace]] - a Bowgunner fused with an Anjanath
- [[Specimens/2 - Theodore|2 - Theodore]] - An seasoned, headstrong Insect Glaive user who merged with and partially overwrote a Legiana.
- [[Specimens/3 - Elara|3 - Elara]] - Other Researcher who left with Maya that was fused with a Tzitzi-Ya-Ku.
- [4 & 5 - Jasper & Rowan](Specimens/4%20&%205%20-%20Jasper%20&%20Rowan.md) - Dual-Blades-wielding twins that were fused into a Great Girros.
- [[Specimens/6 - Cecil|6 - Cecil]] 
- [[Specimens/7 -Seraphina & Bloom|7 -Seraphina & Bloom]] - A Bow user who has a Pukei-Pukei for her lower body. Bloom's head is now on her tail.
- [[Specimens/8 - Maya & Sadie + Amber|8 - Maya & Sadie + Amber]] - A Paolumu Research Specialist fused with a pair of Paolumu.

## Abomination
A fusion of two or more [[#Eldertouched]] monsters. The most noticeable Abominations are between two different species, but are most commonly fusions within the same species.

Abominations are also much more common than Aberrations. This is also because human/monster contact is far more rare.
## Elderblooms
Macroflora created from exposure to [[#Eldertaint]]. Generally signify an area heavily affected by Eldertaint.

## Eldertaint
A strange energy released by Xeno'jiiva, which can radically alter any flora & fauna exposed to it in unpredictable ways.

## Eldertouched
Beings affected by the Eldertaint.

## Intraspecies Abominations
[[#Abomination|Abominations]] caused by the fusion of two or more members of the same species.
This variant is extremely common, and usually at least visually similar to the standard members of their species. 

Symptoms include:
- Increased size;
- Extraneous parts, including but not limited to heads, legs, and tails;
- Increased physical attributes, such as strength and speed;


## Interspecies Abominations
[[#Abomination|Abominations]] caused by the fusion of two or more members of different species.
Unlike [[#Intraspecies Abominations]], this variant is relatively uncommon. Though they are easier to spot as they vary far more wildly from their component species.

Symptoms include:
- Unstable forms, often with heads and limbs sticking out at unnatural angles;
- Highly-aggressive behavior;
- Increased physical size and strength;

## Irregularity
A (theoretical) Eldertouched fusion of two humans. None have been reported.
