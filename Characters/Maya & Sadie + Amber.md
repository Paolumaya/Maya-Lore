## Description of Form:
### ***IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the abnormal circumstances of her dual integration, subject's body is not static. The following are the Subject's self-expressed "favorite forms"***
- #### Most Commonly Observed Form ("Bipedal Taur"):
	- Subject's upper segment resembles a humanoid torso, with key differences being:
		- A thin layer of white fur across the sides, back, shoulders, and head; brown fur on the stomach and arms, and pink skin on the face
		- Subject has four arms rather than two.
		- Humanoid neck has a permanent fluffy collar.
		- Two long tubes of fur extend from the back of subject's head, ending in the heads of the two Paolumu she bonded with
		- Arms end in brown fur, looking similar to normal Paolumu legs, but lacking scales and with human-like hands.
	- Lower half looks like a normal Paolumu, with the exception of having both male and female gonads.
	- Abnormally large, far outstripping the size of the largest adult Paolumu on record at 1752.61 centimeters long.
- #### Alternative Form ("Quadrupedal Taur")
	- Upper segment is as above with additional deviations including:
		- Wings protrude from upper torso's back
	- Lower segment takes on four legs in an arrangement similar to a Kirin.
		- Legs are otherwise similar to standard Paolumu legs.

## Reaction to Dragon Energy Exposure/Overexposure:

- High-to-Extreme Exposure:
	- Subject experiences a total loss of control over form, emotions, and fine motor functions.
	- Depending on emotions expressed, individual parts, or entire body, may grow or shrink.

## Discovered By Guild:
- Subject was discovered 2 weeks after the defeat of Xeno'jiiva in the Coral Highlands.

## Given Reason For Close Contact With Monster(s):
- Maya was assigned to an expedition to the Coral Highlands.
- Maya was on an expedition to the Coral Highlands to study the pair, who were initially thought to be a same-sex female couple, due to Amber's claw length and dull stomach scale color, before Amber was reassessed as male. After 8 days of observation, Maya discovered them both gravely injured in their nest, after a fight with a Legiana.  Maya approached with caution, and began to use what little she had to tend to their wounds. According to her, as she was tending to Amber's wounds, a blue light blinded her. She stumbled forward, onto the pair and passed out.  When she came to, her body was entirely different. Her legs had attached to the necks of the Paolumu, which had themselves fused together into a hermaphroditic Paolumu.
