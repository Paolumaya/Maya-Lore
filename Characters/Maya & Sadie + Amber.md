##### Discovered By Guild:
- Subject was discovered 8 days after the defeat of Xeno'jiiva in the Coral Highlands.
##### Given Reason For Close Contact With Monster(s):
- Maya was assigned to an expedition to the Coral Highlands.
- Maya was on an expedition to the Coral Highlands to study the pair, who were initially thought to be a same-sex female couple, due to Amber's claw length and dull stomach scale color, before Amber was reassessed as male. After 8 days of observation, Maya discovered them both gravely injured in their nest, after a fight with a Legiana.  Maya approached with caution, and began to use what little she had to tend to their wounds. According to her, as she was tending to Amber's wounds, a blue light blinded her. She stumbled forward, onto the pair and passed out.  When she came to, her body was entirely different. Her legs had attached to the necks of the Paolumu, which had themselves fused together into a hermaphroditic Paolumu.
