### AKA [[Aberration]] Specimen #5

Discovered in Wildspire Wastes 3 days after the defeat of Xeno'jiiva
She had been MIA for about 2 weeks at the time of the incident, as she was raising the young Pukei.

Bloom was a orphaned male Pukei-Pukei that Seraphina was raising in the Wastes.

Extremely unique, as her default form is bipedal, but her body has taken on the appearance of a Pukei-Pukei. Her tail is long and capped with Bloom's head.

She was distraught over the transformation, but is happy that it means she doesn't have to hide Bloom anymore.

Exposure to dragon energy allow her and Bloom to communicate mentally and share control of their body.
Overexposure allows Bloom to take full control of their body and potentially wreak havoc or embarrass Seraphina in public.
