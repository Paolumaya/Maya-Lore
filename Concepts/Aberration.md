A fusion of monster and human.
Caused by the massive energy release during the slaying of Xeno'jiiva.
All appear to have some amount of control over their forms.
Observations on this front have found some sort of latent connection between Aberrations and the crystals in the Elder's Recess, which pulse with what has been nicknamed "Dragon Energy"

All 7 of the known 'sane' Aberration cases:
- [Liam & Horace](Characters/Liam%20&%20Horace) - a Bowgunner fused with an Anjanath
- [Theodore](Characters/Theodore) - An seasoned, headstrong Insect Glaive user who merged with and partially overwrote a Legiana.

- [Seraphina & Bloom](Characters/Seraphina%20&%20Bloom) - A Bow user who has a Pukei-Pukei for her lower body. Bloom's head is now on her tail.
